## Projects

### 1. Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) Task

This project is an Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) system designed to detect vehicles and recognize their license plates from video footage. It utilizes YOLO (You Only Look Once) models for object detection and SORT (Simple Online and Realtime Tracking) for tracking, ensuring efficient and accurate recognition even in real-time scenarios.
